## Needle v1.2.0 released: now with non-interactive mode

Needle v1.2.0 has just been released, introducing another feature that should make your life even more easier: **[non-interactive mode](https://github.com/mwrlabs/needle/wiki/Non-interactive-Mode)**. 
A new command line interface (`needle-cli.py`) will now allow to completely script Needle and will serve (together with the automatic issue detection introduced in v1.1.0) as a baseline to integrate Needle within a CI pipeline.

Alongside this, v1.2.0 introduces few hooking modules based on Frida, and fixes some stability issues.

At the same time, we just released NeedleAgent v1.0.4, with some minor UI improvements (the device's IP address is now shown in the main screen).
