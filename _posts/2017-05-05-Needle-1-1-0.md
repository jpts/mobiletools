## Needle v1.1.0 released: now with automatic issue detection

Needle v1.1.0 has just been released, introducing **automatic issue detection**: modules will now automatically detect and keep track of issues in the target app. All the issues are going to be stored in the `issues.db` SQLite database, contained in the chosen output directory. 
New commands have also been added to the core of needle to allow you to make use of this new feature: `issues` (to list all the issues identified), and `add_issue` (if you want to manually add an issue to the collection).

Alongside this, v1.1.0 introduces a new dependency installer (`device/dependency_installer`), which offers a more granular support, and stability fixes like automatic reconnection if the SSH/Agent connection drops.

### Added
- **[CORE]** Issue Auto-Detection: modules will now automatically detect and keep track of issues in the target app. 
All the issues are going to be stored in the `issues.db` SQLite database, contained in the chosen output directory.
Every issue will hold the following attributes: `app`, `module`, `name`, `content`, `confidence level` ('HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'INVESTIGATE', 'INFORMATIONAL'), `outfile`
