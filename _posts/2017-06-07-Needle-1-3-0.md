## Needle v1.3.0 released: now supporting System Apps

Needle v1.3.0 has just been released, introducing another feature that will expand its capabilities: **support for System Applications**. Now you'll have the chance to choose as a target not only 3rd party, but even system applications deployed by Apple itself...happy hunting!

Alongside this, v1.3.0 improves few methods with automatic issue detection: `binary/info/provisioning_profile`, `hooking/frida/script_anti-hooking-check`.

At the same time, we just released NeedleAgent v1.0.5, with some minor improvements (`BundleType` and `SignerIdentity` are now included in the apps' metadata).

Release tags:

* [https://github.com/mwrlabs/needle-agent/releases/tag/v1.0.5](https://github.com/mwrlabs/needle-agent/releases/tag/v1.0.5)
