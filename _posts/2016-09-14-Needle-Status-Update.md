## Needle Status Update

We've been quite busy developing Needle for the last few months, and we were happy to release it at [Black Hat Arsenal USA 2016](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/arsenal.html#needle). But what happens now?

Well, we have a few conferences already lined up where you can catch up directly with Needle and its creators:

* **OWASP AppSec USA 2016 _[October 14, Washington DC]_**: in his talk named "[Needle: Finding Issues within iOS Applications](https://appsecusa2016.sched.org/event/7tAm/needle-finding-issues-within-ios-applications)", Marco Lancini will show how Needle can be used both by security professionals and developers to assess the security of iOS applications

* **Black Hat Arsenal EU 2016 _[November 3, London]_**: Needle will come back to [Arsenal](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-16/arsenal.html#needle) (Europe, this time!) to showcase its new features

* **DEEPSEC 2016 _[November 8-9, Vienna]_**: for those who want a hands-on approach on iOS exploitation, Marco will deliver a [2-day workshop](https://deepsec.net/speaker.html#WSLOT239) at DEEPSEC this November. This exercise-driven training course will use detailed tutorials to guide the attendee through all the steps necessary to exploit a real iOS application, and, in the process, provide an understanding of the modern attackerâ€™s mind-set and capabilities. The course will cover iOS hacking, from the basics of vulnerability hunting on the platform to advanced exploitation techniques.

There's still time ro register to the workshop, go [grab a ticket](https://deepsec.net/register.html)!
